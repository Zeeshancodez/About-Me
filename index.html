    <h1>Welcome to the About section</h1>
    <p>Greetings! I'm Zeeshan, the guy behind ZeeshanCodez. I do a bunch of stuff—write words that make sense, design logos, and mess around with websites. I'm not a web wizard, but I get the hang of it.</p>
    <p>When I'm not doing the usual, I'm in the world of terminals and Termux, trying to look cool with command lines lol. I'm also pals with Rust, not like besties, but we get along.</p>
    <p>You know what's my secret sauce? Prompt engineering. It's like being a command-line maestro. It's not rocket science; it's just my way of having fun with tech.</p>
    <p>ZeeshanCodez is more than just a username; it's my adventure in mixing creativity and tech. It's like playing with Legos but in the digital world.</p>
    <p>Beyond the digital buzz, you'll find me escaping into a good book, especially sci-fi and fantasy. Sure, I enjoy the tech side, but I'm more than just codes and pixels.</p>
    <p>—I'm not your stereotypical tech nerd. I might geek out on terminals and Rust and etc etc, but that's just part of the fun.</p>
    <p>anythin else left?</p>
